## Development 🛠️

- ### Requirements 📋

  - Python 3.12.0+

- ### Setup ⚙️

  - Clone the repository and open a terminal **inside** it.

  - Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    # It is it recommend that a virtual environment is set before doing this!

    pip install .
    ```

  - Start the app:

    ```shell
    python src/main.py
    ```

- ### Tooling 🧰

  - Ruff is used as a linter and formatter:

    ```shell
    pip install .[check]
    ruff check --fix
    ruff format

    # To automatically lint and format on every commit install the pre-commit hooks:
    pre-commit install

    # When using pre-commit hooks, git commands will fail if any files are checked with errors.
    # Changed files must be added to the staged area and commited again to apply fixes.
    ```

  - PyTest and PyTest-Qt are used for testing:

    ```shell
    pip install .[test]
    pytest
    ```

  - Nuitka is used for cross-compiling to all supported platforms:

    ```shell
    pip install .[build]
    nuitka <options>
    ```

    See the build [workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yaml) for a list of options used for each platform.
